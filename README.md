# Golem: "scrap your boilerplate" for Go

**golem** is a pure functional and generic programming for Go. It had its origins in [Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf) by Chris Okasaki, on implementing a various higher rank functional abstractions and patterns, on dealing with [scrap your boilerplate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/scrap-your-boilerplate-with-class/) and gaining experience from other functional languages primary Scala, Haskell and heavily inspired by its Erlang twin [datum](https://github.com/fogfish/datum). The library is testing the limits of functional abstractions in Go.
